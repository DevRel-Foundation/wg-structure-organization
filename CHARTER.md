Developer Relations teams vary significantly across organizations, influenced by company size, customer personas, and strategic priorities. The DevRel Foundation’s Structure and Org Working Group aims to identify and categorize the different models of DevRel teams, understanding how these factors shape their function. This working group will produce resources that help organizations define, evaluate, and optimize their DevRel teams to align with business goals.
